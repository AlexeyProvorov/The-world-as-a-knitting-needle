How we can connect simulation with the LLM model? 
Like a ruler of simulation? But, how? 

- Try to connect any simulation logic to the LLM model
	- LLM as a responder to your letter. How to force LLMs respond for simulation?
		- LLM have to be inside every object inside the simulation. And how to learn LLM respond to questions in her own manner? 
			- LLM has to respond only about her own information. So, we need to learn every LLM separately. But how to learn LLM act at the field?
