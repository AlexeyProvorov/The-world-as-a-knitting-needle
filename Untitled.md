I’m applying to the OpenAI Residency because I want to focus on deep research in an environment where long-term thinking and rigorous experimentation matter.

My path is non-traditional: I’ve spent ~6–7 years working across data analysis, applied ML, and research-oriented projects. I started in domains like sports analytics and computer vision, where messy data and shifting distributions are the norm. Over time, my interests shifted from simply getting models to work toward understanding what they represent internally and how complex behaviors emerge under real constraints.

Today, I work at Constructor Group as an ML researcher, focusing on multi-agent systems and the internal dynamics of models. I’m particularly interested in how structure forms, how behavior changes under different incentives, and what makes learned representations stable and transferable.

I’m largely self-taught and used to building my own learning structure: reading papers, reproducing ideas, and validating them through experiments. I’m drawn to OpenAI because it’s one of the few places where deep technical curiosity is combined with the responsibility of building real, impactful systems.
