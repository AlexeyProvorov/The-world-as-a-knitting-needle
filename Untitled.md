I’m applying to the OpenAI Residency because I want to focus on deep research in an environment where long-term thinking, curiosity, and rigorous experimentation are central.

My path is non-traditional: I spent ~6–7 years across data analysis, applied ML, and research-oriented work. I started in real-world domains like sports analytics and computer vision, where ambiguity, messy data, and shifting distributions are the norm. Over time, my interests shifted from “getting a model to work” toward understanding what models represent internally and how complex behaviors emerge—especially in multi-agent settings.

Today I work at Constructor Group as an ML researcher / data scientist, focusing on multi-agent systems and representation learning. I’m particularly interested in latent structure, internal dynamics of models, and interpretability—how useful abstractions form, how they change during training, and what makes them stable and transferable.

I’m self-taught and used to building my own structure: reading papers, reproducing ideas, designing experiments, and iterating. I’m excited about OpenAI because it combines strong research culture with the scale and resources needed to push exploratory research further than I can in my current setting.
