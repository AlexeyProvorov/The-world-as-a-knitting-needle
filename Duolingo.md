1. Modern caffe shop
On this wonderful photo created inside the contemporary, modern and stylish coffee shop we see a lot of kitchen accessories and a person who, as I can suppose, likely works here as a barmen. Behind the counter there are several shelves that have been hung on the wall. On this shelves placed green and transparent bottles, small and medium boxes and several green plants at the top. In front of the counter there are light-brown drawers that organically complement the amazing atmosphere of this cozy caffe shop. An empty wooden chair on the left of the photo has been made using grids. A barmen dressed in a white long sleeve T-shirt. 


2. Memories of relaxation
When I think about this topic, what comes to mind is a holiday I once went on. My sister and I spend a long weekend in a little village on one of the Greek Islands. We hadn't known what to expect really, but all of us needed a holiday.
We were so impressed when we arrived - I remember the friendly atmosphere in the village like it was yesterday. We didn't really do a lot of activities as such, but I have a really clear recollection of walking along a pristine beach and feeling incredibly calm and positive. In fact, due to the tranquil location, my impression was one of complete relaxation and there were none of the pressures of daily life to worry about. 
This can be seen in the photos I took, where we all look so peaceful. There wasn't a single moment when we weren't feeling our best. A particular instance of this was when I fell asleep while sunbathing in the park, something that would never happen at home. 
All things considered I'd say that's the most relaxed I've ever felt, and I'd love to come back to that village. I can't finish without mentioning how positive the holiday was for my mental health - I'm still feeling the benefits to this day. 

3. Caving. Subterranean exploring.
Caving, also known as spelunking, involves exploring subterranean landscapes and underground passages. Enthusiasts often venture into caves formed by water or volcanic activity to admire their activity to admire their unique rock formations like stalactites stalagmites. This activity requires resilience, perseverance and equipment to navigate safely. Caving not only allows participants to discover hidden wonders, but also promotes awareness of geological preservation.

5. Describing nature activities
The whether was nice and warm with a gentle breeze, despite the fact that it was September in Serbia. The rolling hills were covered in lush green grass and wildflowers - it really was a lovely place. We spent the day engaged in outdoor pursuits such as exploring trails, crossing streams, and enjoying the stunning views from the picks. 
What made it so enjoyable was the combination of physical activity and tranquility. The peaceful surroundings allowed me to disconnect from daily stresses, and spending time with my family made the experience even more special. We laughed, shared stories, and took plenty of photos along the way. What a wonderful day was it! 

6. The John J. Mearshelmer's article review.
Join Maershelmer is an American political scientist and best known for developing the theory of offensive realism, which describes relationships and interactions between great powers in the world as a struggle to achieve the regional hegemony. He, also, well known as an author of books at the political subject based on the foreign government's point of view. 
After reading his short article dedicated to the American approach to aggressive democracy promotion, I've been left with something to think about. 
At the very beginning  let's me define that I am not a politician and related with the subject only as a hobby. I like explore ways of developing myself and society as a whole, including political direction, but I've never been in USA, I don't have any diploma near to this area. However, as a migrator originally from Russia and a person who have felt this subject on my own, personal experience, I have several truly not superficial thoughts that I would like to express. 
So, let's I reveal my point of view about this article and especially about "offensive realism" because it's the central idea of the author. 
Of course I am agree with several claims and ideas, many things makes sense here, but I absolutely disagree with the final conclusion and the main statement where we look at the government like at the separated entity who wants to struggle for the hegemony, without people's relationships. 
By my opinion there is a essential gap that mislead all subsequent conclusions. The people psychology has a really huge effect on the government and society. Look about the Overton Window ideas - there are a lot of consequences about this social approval theory. 
Also, I can claim that the perspective where we see at the government as it's separated entity, hidden a really harmful effect for humanity. And you know a lot of instances of this effect.
When a person became the leader, society starts recognizing him as a real government, real power. Do you think that this idea innocent? If yes, I suggest you to think about what happens when the person believes that personally he is a government. 
For the instance, Mr. John Mearshelmer said in the article that Europe has provoked Russia for the war against Ukraine. As a person who perfectly know Russia and its government, I am sure that the real problem is the point that one person have not only immeasurable power, but also he believes that he is a government. So, all his cognitive biases also became a government. 
In short, despite the fact that I partially agree with the author, I see a significant flaw in his opinion, and moreover, I believe that studying government without taking into account the behavior and psychology of people is not only strange. because governments are consist of people, but also really harmful. 
That's my honest review on the John J. Mearshelmer's article.

7. Social media has a negative impact on mental health?
Social media has an enormous effect on humanity in general and especially its get a huge impact on people's mental health. I find it difficult to say whether this effect is mostly positive or negative. 
Moreover, I'm not a psychologist to estimate people's mental health and my point of view a bit biased for the reason that I truly rarely use social media in my daily activities, however there are several interesting thoughts I can share. 
At first, historically our life changed a lot thanks to the internet communications. In my childhood I couldn't find new friends, who would understand my passions. Occasionally, I wanted to have someone who would share my hobbies, such as collecting insects or observing birds. So, I was lonely from time to time. 
On the other side the relationships inside social media as vast as it shallow, superficial. I mean that deep human's bonds difficult to achieve and also hard to keep and enhance because of the lack of the common experience from real life. 
I remember reading a book a few months ago that focused on productivity in the digital age. One of the chapters really made me think about the subject. It suggested that social media hadn't just been distracting us from our tasks, but had actually been changing the way we process information and maintain focus. I found this idea quite striking because it's not about immediate distraction, but long-term cognitive shifts. 
Nowadays, I'm trying not to use social media too frequently, nevertheless sometimes I find myself trapped in the snare of social media. 
In conclusion I want to say that I don't consider social media to be eval. Social media brings people together all over the world and makes many aspects of our life easier. Nevertheless, we must be attentive what has such a significant impact on us. 

8. Teenagers have a lack of moral values.
Several years ago I heard a disturbing story that a group of drunk teenagers had danced on the grave of a soldier who had died in the Second World War. 
It was an insult of the memory of sacrifice, to history, to humanity. 
The story happened in Russia, where traditions and memory about the war is considered inviolable and sacred. 
Or here another example that also took place in Russia: the musician band "Pussy Riot" broke into the church and started singing offensive punk songs. It should be said that teenagers were imprisoned for two years for this reckless (or may be innocent) action.
So, why I am speaking about this? We can imagine innumerous instances similar to those, from too revealing clothes to really crazy or dangerous actions. How we can comprehend, is this really abnormal behavior or this is just usual process of human psychology? May be this is the inevitable stage of every generation? 
We have to be smarter and we need to rise our understanding of this problem in our society before accusing others of lacking morals. 
To reveal my perspective I would like to mention about such phenomenon as postmodernism.  
Just to clarify this subject, the society has a common macro psychological trend, that was called postmodernism. This is  like a type of thinking or kind of what an every person believes in. In a brood sense. 
Personally, I love to explain this comparison with the timeline of others stages. That's all of them: premodernism, modernism, postmodernism and metamodernism. 
Premodernism was when people absolutely believed in traditions and God. People overall rejected the study of the world.
After science appeared, people began to try to explain everything in hard logical terms. Mathematic and other sciences have developed. This was called modernism, and here accurate descriptions have become a trend. 
The next one is postmodernism, our main topic today, which explains teenager's behavior. Postmodernism emerged on the basement of contradictions. We understood that we can't explain the world in pure words and hard terms. We became disappointed with the stereotypical approach. So, postmodernism is the idea of breaking the system and rules, going against the current. 
This idea would be even more understandable if we speak about cinema or art. Spider man, X-men and Wolverine, Iron man, The fighting club and literarily almost all contemporary popular movies have a common idea. The main character goes against the current and he brakes the system.
How we can blame teenagers if they just want to imitate they heroes from movies we made?
One of my favorite family cartoon is "Shrek". This masterpiece is a nice example of postmodernism. "Shrek" is laughing at system and at traditions. A nice prince has to take a princess? Oh, it's bullshit, here must be the ogre. Dragons scares you? Don't worry because the talking donkey will marry om the dragon. There are no rules at all. 
Such significant part of our life as memes is a pure postmodernism. All we love to lough at the system. 
Therefore, we cant blame teenagers for their lack of moral values. By my opinion this is a natural process. 
But, do you remember about the stage number four? Scientists believes that it's metamodernism. 
Metamodernism based on new generations. Here people believe that happiness is the very essence of human life. 
To be shortly, you can do everything if you feel happy. That's point. 
Based on this I would be able to predict the behavior in the future, but I will live it to you. Personally, I think that a future where happiness is the most important thing is life is amazing. Nonetheless, maybe this strongly depends on the Overton Window, which define mood and interests of society. 
At the very end I just want to remind you that several generations ago public executions weren't abnormal and people lived thirty - thirty five years in average. Consequently, teenager's lack of moral don't look too scary. Overton Window shifted, and shifted our perception of normality.
9. Public transportation or private cars?

I agree that private cars are more harmful to the environment than public transport. And if we speak only about this aspect I would be completely agree.

Nevertheless, we must take into account that if we speak about vehicles at all, we have to divide the transportation and private cars to green and dependent on oil.  
If we would be able to construct cars without extreme pollutions, my opinion would may change.  
Also if we recall the coronavirus infection we will notice that publick transport has a great vulnerability. People were infected there much more often.

In additional I would say that I use public transport and I can't drive a car. Publick transport is chipper and by my opinion more comfortable in the big city. But if I lived in the countryside a personal car would be absolutely necessary.

To make long story short, I believe that we have to fight for environment and reduce contaminations. And this applies not only to private cars but all sources of pollution. We are responsible for the world.

10. A university degree is essential? 
Some people believe that a university degree is the one good way to find a job, other people think that you don't have to get a degree if you possess necessary skills to fulfill the issue at the job. Where is the truth? In a nutshell, I believe that both groups of people are partly right here and both groups also partly wrong, so the truth placed somewhere in the middle. I am gonna tell you my point of view based on my own way of education. 
My extensive experience that I've got throughout my whole life tells me that I could say something essential about the topic. As an example, I am currently working for an international company without a university degree. 
As you can see, my path shows that higher education is not necessary in order to find a job or even a good job.
Nonetheless, everything in my life is much more complicated and, to be frankly, I can't claim blindly that everybody can find a job they want without education.
What makes me think this way? Well, there are several important points. At the very beginning, we need to find out why employers hire people without higher education? Do they want to find a new blood for the job or maybe they can't find a person who has a higher degree? The right answer is that humanity has progressed too rapidly. To be more precise, only one sphere is developing much faster than others. I mean technologies, of course. 
Our educational system is developing slowly if we compare it with technologies. 
Eighty percent of teachers in my school and my unfinished university were really elderly. All we know that elderly people have difficulties with new technologies. Consequently, even in the best universities they teach irrelevant information. 
Therefore, we have a situation when emp





I need to mention here that I am talking only about higher education, but not about education in general. So, your hard self-education has to be with you during all your life.
