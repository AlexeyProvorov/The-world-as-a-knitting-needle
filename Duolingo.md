1. Modern caffe shop
On this wonderful photo created inside the contemporary, modern and stylish coffee shop we see a lot of kitchen accessories and a person who, as I can suppose, likely works here as a barmen. Behind the counter there are several shelves that have been hung on the wall. On this shelves placed green and transparent bottles, small and medium boxes and several green plants at the top. In front of the counter there are light-brown drawers that organically complement the amazing atmosphere of this cozy caffe shop. An empty wooden chair on the left of the photo has been made using grids. A barmen dressed in a white long sleeve T-shirt. 


2. Memories of relaxation
When I think about this topic, what comes to mind is a holiday I once went on. My sister and I spend a long weekend in a little village on one of the Greek Islands. We hadn't known what to expect really, but all of us needed a holiday.
We were so impressed when we arrived - I remember the friendly atmosphere in the village like it was yesterday. We didn't really do a lot of activities as such, but I have a really clear recollection of walking along a pristine beach and feeling incredibly calm and positive. In fact, due to the tranquil location, my impression was one of complete relaxation and there were none of the pressures of daily life to worry about. 
This can be seen in the photos I took, where we all look so peaceful. There wasn't a single moment when we weren't feeling our best. A particular instance of this was when I fell asleep while sunbathing in the park, something that would never happen at home. 
All things considered I'd say that's the most relaxed I've ever felt, and I'd love to come back to that village. I can't finish without mentioning how positive the holiday was for my mental health - I'm still feeling the benefits to this day. 

3. Caving. Subterranean exploring.
Caving, also known as spelunking, involves exploring subterranean landscapes and underground passages. Enthusiasts often venture into caves formed by water or volcanic activity to admire their activity to admire their unique rock formations like stalactites stalagmites. This activity requires resilience, perseverance and equipment to navigate safely. Caving not only allows participants to discover hidden wonders, but also promotes awareness of geological preservation.

5. Describing nature activities
The whether was nice and warm with a gentle breeze, despite the fact that it was September in Serbia. The rolling hills were covered in lush green grass and wildflowers - it really was a lovely place. We spent the day engaged in outdoor pursuits such as exploring trails, crossing streams, and enjoying the stunning views from the picks. 
What made it so enjoyable was the combination of physical activity and tranquility. The peaceful surroundings allowed me to disconnect from daily stresses, and spending time with my family made the experience even more special. We laughed, shared stories, and took plenty of photos along the way. What a wonderful day was it! 

6. The John J. Mearshelmer's article review.
Join Maershelmer is an American political scientist and best known for developing the theory of offensive realism, which describes relationships and interactions between great powers in the world as a struggle to achieve the regional hegemony. He, also, well known as an author of books at the political subject based on the foreign government's point of view. 
After reading his short article dedicated to the American approach to aggressive democracy promotion, I've been left with something to think about. 
At the very beginning  let's me define that I am not a politician and related with the subject only as a hobby. I like explore ways of developing myself and society as a whole, including political direction, but I've never been in USA, I don't have any diploma near to this area. However, as a migrator originally from Russia and a person who have felt this subject on my own, personal experience, I have several truly not superficial thoughts that I would like to express. 
So, let's I reveal my point of view about this article and especially about "offensive realism" because it's the central idea of the author. 
Of course I am agree with several claims and ideas, many things makes sense here, but I absolutely disagree with the final conclusion and the main statement where we look at the government like at the separated entity who wants to struggle for the hegemony, without people's relationships. 
By my opinion there is a essential gap that mislead all subsequent conclusions. The people psychology has a really huge effect on the government and society. Look about the Overton Window ideas - there are a lot of consequences about this social approval theory. 
Also, I can claim that the perspective where we see at the government as it's separated entity, hidden a really harmful effect for humanity. And you know a lot of instances of this effect.
When a person became the leader, society starts recognizing him as a real government, real power. Do you think that this idea innocent? If yes, I suggest you to think about what happens when the person believes that personally he is a government. 
For the instance, Mr. John Mearshelmer said in the article that Europe has provoked Russia for the war against Ukraine. As a person who perfectly know Russia and its government, I am sure that the real problem is the point that one person have not only immeasurable power, but also he believes that he is a government. So, all his cognitive biases also became a government. 
In short, despite of I partly agree with author, I see the significant flaw in his opinion and more I believe that to explore government without people behavior and psychology not only strange, becou
