1. Modern caffe shop
On this wonderful photo created inside the contemporary, modern and stylish coffee shop we see a lot of kitchen accessories and a person who, as I can suppose, likely works here as a barmen. Behind the counter there are several shelves that have been hung on the wall. On this shelves placed green and transparent bottles, small and medium boxes and several green plants at the top. In front of the counter there are light-brown drawers that organically complement the amazing atmosphere of this cozy caffe shop. An empty wooden chair on the left of the photo has been made using grids. A barmen dressed in a white long sleeve T-shirt. 


2. Memories of relaxation
When I think about this topic, what comes to mind is a holiday I once went on. My sister and I spend a long weekend in a little village on one of the Greek Islands. We hadn't known what to expect really, but all of us needed a holiday.
We were so impressed when we arrived - I remember the friendly atmosphere in the village like it was yesterday. We didn't really do a lot of activities as such, but I have a really clear recollection of walking along a pristine beach and feeling incredibly calm and positive. In fact, due to the tranquil location, my impression was one of complete relaxation and there were none of the pressures of daily life to worry about. 
This can be seen in the photos I took, where we all look so peaceful. There wasn't a single moment when we weren't feeling our best. A particular instance of this was when I fell asleep while sunbathing in the park, something that would never happen at home. 
All things considered I'd say that's the most relaxed I've ever felt, and I'd love to come back to that village. I can't finish without mentioning how positive the holiday was for my mental health - I'm still feeling the benefits to this day. 

3. Caving. Subterranean exploring.
Caving, also known as spelunking, involves exploring subterranean landscapes and underground passages. Enthusiasts often venture into caves formed by water or volcanic activity to admire their activity to admire their unique rock formations like stalactites stalagmites. This activity requires resilience, perseverance and equipment to navigate safely. Caving not only allows participants to discover hidden wonders, but also promotes awareness of geological preservation.
