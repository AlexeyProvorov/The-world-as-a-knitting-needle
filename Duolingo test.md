In seventeen eighty five, W. H. theorized about the life cycle of stars, in which a star would exist for a limited amount of time before exploding in a dramatic event called a supernova.

Economy is very simple here. Tourists from another country carry money to the museums in the country that they visit. Moreover, travelers spend their money on food, cafes, and other entertainments.

Yes. I'm inclined agree that businesses are one hundred percent responsible for the social life.

So we forced to keep a balance between it. 

When a certain person have already delved into a specific area, there are a lot of limitations that can't afford him to go ahead. So, a person has to read side-area books or learn something that not strongly related with his specialty.
