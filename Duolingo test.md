H. theory was confirmed with the discovery of nebulae and the recognition that stars formed from within these interstellar dust clouds.

In my humble opinion, people often visit museums when they travel to new places because of two key reasons. Firstly, people want to delve deep into the new cultural phenomenon, since for them such experience is like a journey inside an unusual history. Secondly, they want to gather more interesting memories about every place they visit. Overall, museums can provide both cultural values and personal desires to spend time funny.


All money that travelers give for museums follows to the local economy and exhibition's support. Such encourage helps small historical artefacts to be in a good conditions. Economy is very simple here. Tourists from another country carry money to the museums in the country that they visit. Moreover, travelers spend their money on food, cafes, and other entertainments.

Yes. I'm inclined agree that businesses are one hundred percent responsible for the social life. Our contemporary reality has shown that businesses can have an effect on social life or even shape it as they wish. It happens because influence of money and the power of authority.

Some people think that universities have to show a wide range of specialties instead of studying a narrow focused subject. I think that in our contemporary reality the quick technology growth has demonstrated that it's impossible to know very good every area. Also, our tools changes too fast and we can't use it all life. So we forced to keep a balance between it. 

When a certain person have already delved into a specific area, there are a lot of limitations that can't afford him to go ahead. So, a person has to read side-area books or learn something that not strongly related with his specialty.

In front of it there is a narrow path leading to another building on the left side, which is currently under construction. There is also a huge  park in front of the white building, featuring several trees and a grassy area covered with autumn leaves. In the foreground, the two young adults are sitting on a brown bench. Both appear irritated and are not speaking or even looking to each other.  The man is holding his forehead with both hands and staring down at the pavement, while the woman has her head resting on her right hand and is looking away in the opposite direction. They tense body language suggests they may have just had an argument or even broken up. 


Literature, music, and art have a huge influence on how people think and feel. Literature, for example, often challenges the way we see the world and can push for social change. Many books have highlighted important issues like racism or gender inequality, encouraging people to think differently. 
Music is also powerful. Protest songs, for instance, have shaped public opinion in a new light. Art, whether it's painting, sculpture, or performance. can spark important conversations and raise awareness about key social issues. 
On a personal level, literature has greatly impacted me. Reading books from different cultures has expanded my perspective and made me more empathetic. 
I feel loke I understood social issues better because of what I've read. Music also plays a big role in my life. Certain songs have helped me though difficult times by giving me comfort and motivation. Overall, art has shaped how I see the world and what I value. 

Advertising has a big influence on what people decide to buy. It often shows products in an exciting or attractive way, which makes people want to try them. Ads can also make a brand seem popular or trustworthy. Sometimes, people don't even realize an ad  is influencing them - it just sticks in their mind after seeing it several times. That's why companies spend so much money on advertising. 

There are so many tyles of art. People enjoy paintings, sculptures, photography, and drawings. Some like traditional art, like oil painting, while others enjoy modern or digital art. Music, dance, and theater are also forms of art that many people love. It really depends on personal taste - some prefer quiet art in a museum, while others like street art or live performances.

I believe that the school memories have a huge influence to our whole life. However, my point of view is based on unusual perspective of this effect. Some time our negative or positive experience can get effect in a curve way, but not like we used to think. For example, my school was terrible by my opinion. This is a pure hotbed of bulling. Therefore, instead of accept a weak fate, I made my life strong and achieved many personal aims, and my very first step, first decision was to leave the school and go to another city for graduating a university. Overall, I agree that school has a huge influence in our life, because I got a big effect of the school, but my memories rather bed then good.   
And I had to weigh the pros and cons.
