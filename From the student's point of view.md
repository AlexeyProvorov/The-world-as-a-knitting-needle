I will describe my feelings and thoughts of contemporary education here.

Motivation for students divided into several parts. 
## Global 
- Why I need to get this particular degree?
- What is my future profession/specialization?
- Necessity to ensure a fun and stable position in the future
- Feel important and in demand
- Keep communication with peers
- My role should be consistent with goals, values, interests 
- (?)May be thoughts about my ambitions(?)

## Middle
- Why is this course important for me and how it helps me to go ahead
- How to overcome everything "in time", the schedule uncertainty
- Necessity to know my next steps to set up and plan my nearest life overall. 

## Local
I need to finish everything "in time", so, I feel that I wanna finish every stage ASAP
