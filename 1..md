I'm here. And what should choose? 
I swallow my saliva and look hesitantly at the bottles of fruit juice. 
Pineapple juice on the left and orange juice on the right. 
The atmosphere on the left is more exotic and positive, but on the other side...
Orange juice contains a vitamin C, so, It is more beneficial for my health.
I look at this nearly two minutes, and after this took the pineapple pack. 
This is what I want right now a bit more, I suppose. 
I make a step and something is stopping me.
