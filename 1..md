I'm here. And what should choose? 
I swallow my saliva and look hesitantly at the bottles of fruit juice. 
Pineapple juice on the left and orange juice on the right. 
The atmosphere on the left is more exotic and positive, but on the other side...
Orange juice contains a vitamin C, so, It is more beneficial for my health.
I look at this nearly two minutes, and after this took the pineapple pack. 
That's what I want more right now, I guess. 
I take a step, and something stops me. 
I have no idea why my personal choices are more important then what my body needs. 
I look at the pack and feel insecure. 
Take a deep breath... Is it a panic attack?
Take a deep breath... deeper than before.
And... I putting it exactly on its place. 
And my feelings are free, I go out without
