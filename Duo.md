On this wonderful photo created inside the contemporary, modern and stylish coffee shop we see a lot of kitchen accessories and a person who, as I can suppose, likely works here as a barmen. Behind the counter there are several shelves that have been hung on the wall. On this shelves placed green and transparent bottles, small and medium boxes and several green plants at the top. In front of the counter there are light-brown drawers that organically complement the amazing atmosphere of this cozy caffe shop. An empty wooden chair on the left of the photo has been made using grids. A barmen dressed in a white long sleeve T-shirt.
